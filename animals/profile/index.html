    <h1>Haruo</h1>

    <p>Haruo is an observer.</p>

    <p><em>animals</em> is not presented as finished artwork or a message.<br>
      What you see here are traces of observation &mdash; recorded as they appeared, without interpretation.</p>

    <p>Haruo is only one observation point.<br>
      Every observation is shaped by time, culture, body, and experience.<br>
      If someone else were to observe <em>animals</em>, something different might appear.</p>

    <p>This project does not aim to explain, define, or conclude.<br>
      It continues by observing and recording, and by leaving space for what cannot be fixed into meaning.</p>

    <p>You do not need knowledge of art to engage with this work.<br>
      You do not need to understand it.<br>
      Its existence, as an ongoing record, is enough.</p>

    <h2>About support</h2>

    <p><em>animals</em> exists through continuous observation and recording.</p>

    <p>Support is not a purchase, and not agreement with an interpretation.<br>
      It is a way to help keep this observation ongoing.</p>

    <p>If you feel that this activity should continue &mdash;<br>
      that it should remain present, even quietly &mdash; that is sufficient reason.</p>
