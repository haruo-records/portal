  <h1>Support</h1>

  <p><em>animals</em> is maintained as an open, ongoing record.</p>

<p>
  The record began in <strong>April 1998</strong>, with drawings made over the following years.
  Some of these works were shown publicly in limited exhibitions,
  including a gallery exhibition in <strong>2005</strong> and a selected entry in a design competition in <strong>2007</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  After a long period of inactivity,
  the record has been observed again since <strong>2026</strong>,
  with a small number of new entries added gradually.
</p>

<p>
  This page exists only to describe how that record is sustained.
</p>


  <h2>About support</h2>

  <p>
    Support functions solely as a way
    to help keep the record publicly available &mdash;
    to maintain the conditions under which
    observation and recording can continue.
  </p>

  <p>
    Support does not define meaning.<br>
    It does not shape direction.<br>
    It does not accelerate production.
  </p>

  <p>
    Nothing more is promised.<br>
    Nothing else is required.
  </p>

  <h2>What this support sustains</h2>

  <p>
    Support is applied to the practical continuity of <em>animals</em>
    as a publicly accessible record over time.
  </p>

  <p>
    The record is not hosted as a finished work,
    nor as a project with a planned conclusion.
    It is placed in an environment intended
    for long-term persistence beyond individual presence.
  </p>

  <p>
    The same observer also maintains other independent records<sup>*</sup>
    that exist alongside <em>animals</em>,
    following similar principles of quiet documentation.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each record remains separate.<br>
    No unified message or conclusion is intended.
  </p>
