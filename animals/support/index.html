    <h1>Support</h1>

  <p><em>animals</em> is maintained as an open, ongoing record.</p>

  <p>This page exists only to describe how that record is sustained.</p>

  <h2>About support</h2>

  <p>Support functions solely as a way to help keep the record publicly available &mdash;<br>
     to maintain the conditions under which observation and recording can continue.</p>

  <p>Nothing more is promised.<br>
     Nothing else is required.</p>

  <h2>What this support sustains</h2>

  <p>Support is applied to the practical continuity of <em>animals</em><br>
     as a publicly accessible record.</p>

  <p>The same observer also maintains other independent records*<br>
     that exist alongside <em>animals</em>, following similar principles of quiet documentation.</p>

  <p>Each record remains separate.<br>
     No unified message or conclusion is intended.</p>

  <h2>How to support</h2>
